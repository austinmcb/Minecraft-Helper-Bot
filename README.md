# Mineflayer Speedrun Bot

This project leverages the [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) library to create a Minecraft bot capable of simulating a simplified speedrun. The bot performs tasks such as gathering resources, crafting tools, and mining, serving as a foundation for a fully automated Minecraft speedrun bot.

## Features
- **Resource Gathering**: Collects wood, stone, and iron to craft tools.
- **Crafting System**: Crafts essential tools, armor, and weapons.
- **Portal Creation**: Builds a Nether portal using buckets and lava pools.
- **Nether Navigation**: Collects blaze rods and ender pearls to prepare for the End.
- **Stronghold Location**: Finds and navigates the stronghold using Eyes of Ender.
- **Ender Dragon Battle**: Destroys end crystals and fights the Ender Dragon to complete the speedrun.

## Prerequisites
- **Minecraft Java Edition Vr.1.20.4**: Required to connect to the bot's server.
- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system to run the bot.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local machine or download the files directly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/mineflayer-speedrun-bot.git
cd mineflayer-speedrun-bot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
From the project directory, install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install mineflayer
npm install mineflayer-pathfinder
```

### 3. Configure the Bot
Open `bot.js` and update the configuration with your Minecraft server settings:

- **username**: The bot’s display name (e.g., `"SpeedRunnerBot"`).
- **host**: Use `localhost` if the server is running locally, or enter your server's IP address.
- **port**: The server port, default is `25565`.

Example configuration in `Aibot.js`:
```javascript
const bot = mineflayer.createBot({
    username: "SpeedRunnerBot",
    host: "localhost",
    port: 25565,
});
```

### 4. Start Your Minecraft Server
Ensure that your Minecraft server is online and matches the IP and port specified in `Aibot.js`. The bot will attempt to connect to this server on startup.

### 5. Run the Bot
In the terminal, navigate to the project folder and start the bot using:

```bash
node Aibot.js
```

The bot will connect to the specified Minecraft server and begin executing its tasks.

### Commands
You can control the bot within Minecraft chat using the following commands:
- **`start`**: Starts the bot's speedrun tasks, including gathering wood, crafting tools, and more.
- **`stop`**: Stops the bot's actions and disconnects it from the server.

### Example Workflow
Once started, the bot will:
1. Gather wood from nearby trees.
2. Craft basic wooden tools.
3. Search for and mine stone, then craft stone tools.
4. Locate and mine iron, smelting it if a furnace is available.

The bot provides real-time feedback in Minecraft chat as it progresses through each task.

## Advanced Usage
This bot serves as a foundation for a Minecraft speedrun bot, focusing on early game tasks. To expand its functionality, consider adding features such as:
- Combat handling for mobs.
- Navigating the Nether and End.
- Locating and activating the End Portal.
  
These additions would require more advanced programming and game mechanics.

## Troubleshooting
- **Connection Refused**: Double-check the Minecraft server IP and port in `Aibot.js` to ensure they match the server settings.
- **Version Mismatch**: `mineflayer` may not support all Minecraft versions. Check the Mineflayer documentation to ensure compatibility.
- **Dependency Issues**: Make sure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install`.

### Changes and Improvements
1. **Clear Dependency Installation**: Streamlined to a single command with a note on required packages.
2. **Configuration Instructions**: Updated to clarify the usage of `username`, `host`, and `port`.
3. **Commands Section**: Provided more detail on what each command does within Minecraft.
4. **Example Workflow**: Organized into a step-by-step list, making it easier to understand the bot's actions.
5. **Advanced Usage**: Suggested enhancements to expand the bot’s functionality.
6. **Troubleshooting**: Improved readability with specific error resolutions.
